# C2Sentinel

**C2Sentinel** is a minimal Command and Control (C2) framework built for **educational and research purposes only**.  
It demonstrates the core communication model between a C2 server and an agent, using Winsock for TCP connections.

---

## üìú Features
- Basic C2 server-client communication
- Agent persistence via Windows Registry
- Configurable IP and Port via config files (`server_config.txt` / `agent_config.txt`)

---

## üìÇ Project Structure
- Sentinel_server.cpp # C2 server source
- Sentinel_agent.cpp # C2 agent source
- server_config.txt # Server IP/Port config
- agent_config.txt # Agent IP/Port config

---
## ‚öôÔ∏è Config File Format
Both config files follow this format:
- IP=127.0.0.1
- PORT=4444

- **Server** reads from `server_config.txt`
- **Agent** reads from `agent_config.txt`

---

## üöÄ How to Build & Run

1. Compile both `Sentinel_server.cpp` and `Sentinel_agent.cpp` with a C++ compiler supporting Winsock2 (e.g., MSVC).
2. Place `server_config.txt` in the same directory as the server executable.
3. Place `agent_config.txt` in the same directory as the agent executable.
4. Run the server first, then run the agent.

> üîê Ensure your environment is isolated and used strictly for learning or research.

## üõë Why Development Stopped

While developing additional features (encryption, file transfer, etc.), it became clear that even in an educational context, the potential for misuse is significant.  
To prevent any possible harm or legal risk, the project is now archived and **no further development will be made**.
